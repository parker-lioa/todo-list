The whole app is build with javascript and using react as the framework.

Components:
  1.AddBar 
  2.task list
  3.single task 

Note:
  no redux is envolved in this project.
  use props and state to implement all functionality
  use sass as the css preprocessor
 


In the future, i will add backend to save the data, making this cross-device app.


1. use mongoDB and express to implement backend.
2. ios app version using swift.
